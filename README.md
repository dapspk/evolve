Visual search has been picking up some steam over the past year, with the technology being improved to provide more users with the best search results. Along with voice search, this technology has seen more usage thanks to the emergence of quality apps available on mobile devices.

A Visual Search Engine is a search engine designed to search for information on the World Wide Web through the input of an image or a search engine with a visual display of the search results. Information may consist of web pages, locations, other similar images.

While there have been more reliable visual search apps on mobile, some of the best visual search tools can be found on the browser, with the likes of Google and Bing expanding their search capabilities on their services. Starting from simple reverse image search, visual search has expanded to provide more information and context beyond just finding the images that you want to see.

1. Image Storage (BinKit)
2. Visual Image Search (Evolve)
3. Encryp/Decryp of Files (HideMe)
